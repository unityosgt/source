
Photon Unity Networking
	This package is a re-implementation of Unity's Networking, using the Photon Cloud Service.
	Also included: a setup wizard, demo scene, documentation and editor extensions.


Integration
	This package adds a editor window:
	Menu -> Windows, Photon Unity Networking


Server
	Exit Games Photon can be run on your servers or you can subscribe to our cloud service.
	
	The window "Photon Unity Networking" will help you setup a Photon Cloud account.
	This service is geared towards room-based games and the server cannot be modified.
	Read more about it: http://www.exitgamescloud.com

	Alternatively, you can download the server SDK and run your own Photon server.
	The SDK comes with a complete game logic (ready to run, like in Photon Cloud)
	but you also get the source code for the game logic to modify and extend it.
	A 100 concurrent user license is free (also for commercial use) per game.
